# Google Cloud Platform Architecture

The graphs and diagrams in this directory present a possible architecture for providing the AutoTiM service with the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). 

The AutoTiM service is compatible with the GCP (especially the GCP buckets) if a suitable infrastructure is available. To learn more about this, go to the GCS chapter in the global [README.md](../../README.md). 

  > _The graphics in this directory show an architecture where the complete AutoTiM service runs in the GCP, not just the storage._

In addition, there are further graphics that illustrate the workflow of the individual endpoints and the train-pipeline.
